The aim of the task was to create a simple Rails/Coffee application that will pull random phrases from the database and display them one by one (most importantly, that line from the database should be unique on the page).
Phrase should be loaded with Ajax, database must be pre-populated with data.

Setup:
git clone source code
create config/database.yml (application uses Postgre-specific SQL)
run seeds.rb (it'll take some time)
